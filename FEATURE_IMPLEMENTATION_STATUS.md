## 🎯 **Why Features Show as Locked**

The reason some Enterprise features show as locked in the images is because:

1. **Feature flags are correctly set** - The backend correctly identifies these as Enterprise-only features
2. **Feature guards are working** - The UI correctly shows upgrade prompts
3. **But the actual features don't exist** - There are no screens, APIs, or database models for these features

### **Current State:**
- ✅ **Feature Management System** - Working perfectly
- ✅ **Plan-based Feature Locking** - Working perfectly  
- ❌ **Actual Feature Implementation** - Missing for Enterprise features

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Option 1: Implement Missing Enterprise Features**
1. **Multi-Location Support** - Create location management system
2. **Expense Management** - Create expense tracking system
3. **Performance Reviews** - Create performance evaluation system
4. **Training Management** - Create training program system

### **Option 2: Update Feature Definitions**
1. **Remove unimplemented features** from feature management
2. **Keep only implemented features** in the system
3. **Add features back** as they get implemented

### **Option 3: Create Placeholder Screens**
1. **Create basic UI screens** for missing features
2. **Show "Coming Soon" messages**
3. **Implement gradually** over time

---

## 📋 **Recommendation**

**I recommend Option 3 (Create Placeholder Screens)** because:

1. **Maintains feature promise** - Users see what they're paying for
2. **Clear expectations** - "Coming Soon" sets proper expectations
3. **Gradual implementation** - Can add features incrementally
4. **Professional appearance** - Shows planned roadmap

This approach would:
- ✅ Keep the feature management system working
- ✅ Show users what's available in their plan
- ✅ Set clear expectations about implementation timeline
- ✅ Allow for gradual feature rollout
