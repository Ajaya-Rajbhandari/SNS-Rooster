- **Features**:
  - Fetch current company information
  - Update company data
  - Get company usage statistics
  - Feature flag checking
  - Usage limit validation
  - Subscription plan queries

### 3. Company Provider (`lib/providers/company_provider.dart`)
- **Purpose**: State management for company data throughout the app
- **Features**:
  - Company data loading and caching
  - Usage and limits tracking
  - Feature flag management
  - Subscription plan status
  - Usage percentage calculations
  - Error handling and loading states

### 4. Updated API Service (`lib/services/api_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced to include company context in all API requests
- **Features**:
  - Automatic company ID header injection
  - Multi-tenant request support
  - Backward compatibility

### 5. Updated Secure Storage Service (`lib/services/secure_storage_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced to store company-related data securely
- **Features**:
  - Company ID storage and retrieval
  - Company data caching
  - Automatic cleanup on logout

### 6. Updated Auth Provider (`lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced to handle company context during authentication
- **Features**:
  - Company ID extraction from login response
  - Company data clearing on logout
  - Integration with company provider

### 7. Company Info Widget (`lib/widgets/company_info_widget.dart`)
- **Purpose**: UI components for displaying company information
- **Features**:
  - Company information display
  - Subscription plan badges
  - Usage and limits visualization
  - Feature flag indicators
  - Progress bars for usage tracking

## Key Features Implemented

- Company context injection in all API requests
- Secure storage of company data
- Proper cleanup on logout

### 2. Feature Flag System
- Company-specific feature enablement
- Subscription plan-based feature access
- Easy feature checking throughout the app
- Visual indicators for available features

### 3. Usage Limits and Tracking
- Employee count limits
- Storage usage limits
- API request limits
- Usage percentage calculations
- Limit exceeded warnings

### 4. Subscription Plan Management
- Basic, Pro, and Enterprise plan support
- Plan-specific feature access
- Plan-based usage limits
- Visual plan indicators

### 5. Data Isolation
- Company-scoped API requests
- Secure company data storage
- Proper data cleanup
- Multi-tenant data separation

## Integration Points

### 1. Authentication Flow
```dart
// Company ID is automatically extracted and stored during login
if (_user != null && _user!['companyId'] != null) {
  final companyId = _user!['companyId'].toString();
  await SecureStorageService.storeCompanyId(companyId);
}
```

### 2. API Requests
```dart
// Company context is automatically included in all API requests
final headers = <String, String>{
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  if (token != null) 'Authorization': 'Bearer $token',
  if (companyId != null && companyId.isNotEmpty) 'x-company-id': companyId,
};
```

### 3. Feature Checking
```dart
// Easy feature checking throughout the app
if (companyProvider.isFeatureEnabled('analytics')) {
  // Show analytics features
}
```

### 4. Usage Monitoring
```dart
// Usage limit checking
if (companyProvider.isWithinLimit('employees')) {
  // Allow adding new employees
} else {
  // Show upgrade prompt
}
```

## Testing

### Frontend Tests (`test/multi_tenant_frontend_test.dart`)
- Company model creation and serialization
- Feature flag functionality
- Usage limit calculations
- Subscription plan checks
- Provider initialization and state management

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Company model functionality
- ✅ Feature flag system
- ✅ Usage limits and tracking
- ✅ Subscription plan management
- ✅ Provider state management
- ✅ Data serialization

## Usage Examples

### 1. Checking Feature Access
```dart
final companyProvider = Provider.of<CompanyProvider>(context);
if (companyProvider.hasAnalytics) {
  // Show analytics dashboard
}
```

### 2. Monitoring Usage
```dart
final companyProvider = Provider.of<CompanyProvider>(context);
if (companyProvider.isEmployeeLimitReached) {
  // Show upgrade prompt
}
```

### 3. Displaying Company Info
```dart
const CompanyInfoWidget(), // Shows company info, usage, and features
const CompanyUsageWidget(), // Shows usage overview
```

### 4. API Integration
```dart
// Company context is automatically handled by ApiService
final response = await apiService.get('/api/employees');
```

## Benefits
