# Task 5: Secure Token Management - COMPLETED

**Status:** Complete (as of 2025-07-15)

## Summary
- Enforced JWT expiration checks before every API call in `DynamicApiService`.
- Implemented refresh token logic: if the access token is expired, the service attempts to refresh it using the refresh token.
- All token storage and refresh flows use secure storage (`SecureStorageService`).
- All HTTP requests (including refresh) use the injected client for testability.
- URL building is robust and works for all valid base URLs.
- Integration test (`integration_test/token_refresh_test.dart`) verifies the refresh logic end-to-end.

## Key Changes
- `DynamicApiService` now has a public constructor for testing (`DynamicApiService.testable`).
- `_tryRefreshToken` uses `_effectiveClient` for all HTTP calls.
- `_buildUrl` uses `Uri.resolve` for correct URL joining.
- Integration test uses a testable subclass and a fake HTTP client.

## How to Test
- Run `flutter test integration_test/token_refresh_test.dart` to verify refresh logic.
- Manual testing: Expire your access token and verify that API calls trigger a refresh automatically.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 6 or next item in SECURITY_FIX_TODO.md.
- Update documentation and inform team of new secure token management flow.
