## 🚨 Critical Rules Embedded Everywhere

The four critical rules are now prominently displayed in multiple locations:

1. **Always increment both version AND build number**
2. **Backend expects NEXT version, not current version**
3. **Deploy APK first, then backend config**
4. **Test the complete flow before releasing**

## 📋 Quick Reference Locations

### **Automated Deployment**
```powershell
# From sns_rooster directory
.\scripts\deploy-app-update.ps1 -NewVersion "1.0.4" -NewBuildNumber "5" -FeatureDescription "new feature"
```

### **Manual Steps**
1. Update `pubspec.yaml` version
2. Build APK with `flutter build apk --release`
3. Update backend to expect NEXT version
4. Deploy APK to backend downloads folder
5. Deploy backend changes
6. Test the complete flow
