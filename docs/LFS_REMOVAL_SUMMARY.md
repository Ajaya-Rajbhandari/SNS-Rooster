# Git LFS Removal Summary

## 🗑️ LFS Removal Completed

### **What Was Removed:**
- ✅ Git LFS hooks and configuration
- ✅ LFS filter settings (`filter.lfs.clean`, `filter.lfs.smudge`, `filter.lfs.process`)
- ✅ `.gitattributes` file (was empty)
- ✅ All LFS-tracked files (APK files were already removed from history)

### **What Remains:**
- ✅ `.gitignore` with `*.apk` exclusion (prevents future APK commits)
- ✅ Clean Git repository without large files
- ✅ Fast Git operations
- ✅ No deployment failures due to LFS budget issues

## 🚀 How Users Get Updates (No LFS Required)

### **Multiple Distribution Channels:**

1. **GitHub Releases** (Primary)
   - Direct download: https://github.com/Ajaya-Rajbhandari/SNS-Rooster/releases/latest
   - No file size limits
   - Release notes and version history

2. **Google Play Store** (Official)
   - Automatic updates for Play Store users
   - Verified and secure distribution

3. **Your Server** (Backup)
   - In-app update detection
   - Controlled by your backend API

4. **Your Website** (Alternative)
   - Branded download experience
   - Custom landing pages

### **Update Flow:**
```
App Launch → Check Version API → Show Update Dialog → User Downloads → Install
```

## 📋 Backend Configuration

The backend provides multiple download sources:

  "download_url": "https://sns-rooster.onrender.com/api/app/download/android/file",
  "alternative_downloads": [
    "https://github.com/Ajaya-Rajbhandari/SNS-Rooster/releases/latest/download/sns-rooster.apk",
    "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snstech.sns_rooster",
    "https://sns-rooster.com/downloads/sns-rooster.apk"
