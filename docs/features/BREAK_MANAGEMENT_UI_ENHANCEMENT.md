# Break Management UI Enhancement

## Summary
This document describes the UI/UX improvements made to the Break Management screen in the SNS Rooster app, focusing on accurate break status, per-employee attendance fetching, and a modernized break history modal.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Accurate Break Status & Actions
- The break status for each employee is now determined by directly fetching today's attendance data for each user using the backend's attendance endpoints.
- The UI only shows the "End Break" button if the employee is checked in, not checked out, and has an active break (a break with `end == null`).
- This prevents errors and ensures the UI matches backend logic.

### 2. Modern Break History Modal
- The break history modal now displays each break as a card with:
  - Break type (if available)
  - Formatted start and end times (shows "Ongoing" if the break is active)
  - Duration in minutes
  - An icon and improved spacing for clarity
- If there are no breaks, a friendly message is shown.

### 3. Per-Employee Attendance Fetching
- Instead of using a shared provider, the app now fetches attendance data for each employee individually using `AttendanceService`.
- This ensures that break and check-in data is accurate for every user in the list.

## Before
- Break status and history could be inaccurate or show errors if the backend endpoints were missing or if the provider was overwritten.
- The break history modal was plain and hard to read.
- The "End Break" button could appear even when the backend would reject the action.

## After
- Break status and actions are always in sync with backend logic.
- The break history modal is visually clear and user-friendly.
- Only valid actions are shown to the admin.

## Implementation Notes
- Attendance data is fetched using `AttendanceService.getAttendanceStatusWithData(userId)` for each employee.
- The UI logic checks for `checkInTime`, `checkOutTime`, and breaks with `end == null` to determine status and available actions.
- The modal uses a helper to format date/times for readability.
