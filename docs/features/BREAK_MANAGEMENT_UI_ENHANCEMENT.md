# Break Management UI Enhancement

## Summary
This document describes the UI/UX improvements made to the Break Management screen in the SNS Rooster app, focusing on accurate break status, per-employee attendance fetching, and a modernized break history modal.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Accurate Break Status & Actions
- The break status for each employee is now determined by directly fetching today's attendance data for each user using the backend's attendance endpoints.
- The UI only shows the "End Break" button if the employee is checked in, not checked out, and has an active break (a break with `end == null`).
- This prevents errors and ensures the UI matches backend logic.

### 2. Modern Break History Modal
- The break history modal now displays each break as a card with:
  - Break type (if available)
  - Formatted start and end times (shows "Ongoing" if the break is active)
  - Duration in minutes
  - An icon and improved spacing for clarity
- If there are no breaks, a friendly message is shown.

### 3. Per-Employee Attendance Fetching
- Instead of using a shared provider, the app now fetches attendance data for each employee individually using `AttendanceService`.
- This ensures that break and check-in data is accurate for every user in the list.

## Before
- Break status and history could be inaccurate or show errors if the backend endpoints were missing or if the provider was overwritten.
- The break history modal was plain and hard to read.
- The "End Break" button could appear even when the backend would reject the action.

## After
- Break status and actions are always in sync with backend logic.
- The break history modal is visually clear and user-friendly.
- Only valid actions are shown to the admin.

## Implementation Notes
- Attendance data is fetched using `AttendanceService.getAttendanceStatusWithData(userId)` for each employee.
- The UI logic checks for `checkInTime`, `checkOutTime`, and breaks with `end == null` to determine status and available actions.
- The modal uses a helper to format date/times for readability.

# Break Management UI Enhancement (Admin Attendance)

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the break management feature in the Admin Attendance screen of the SNS Rooster app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Break Type Selection Dialog
- When the admin taps **Start Break**, a dialog appears listing all available break types.
- Break types are fetched from the backend (`/attendance/break-types` endpoint).
- Each break type displays:
  - Icon (from backend, mapped to Material icons)
  - Color accent
  - Display name
  - Description (if available)
- The admin selects a break type, which is sent to the backend to start the break.

### 2. Current Break Display
- While on break, the UI shows:
  - The selected break type (icon, color, name)
  - A live timer for the current break duration
- The break type and timer are shown in the **Today's Time** card.

### 3. End Break
- The admin can end the break with a single tap.
- The UI and backend are updated accordingly.

## Technical Details
- Break types are fetched using an authenticated GET request to `/attendance/break-types`.
- The break type selection dialog uses `SimpleDialog` and Material icons.
- The selected break type is sent to the backend when starting a break.
- The UI updates in real time to reflect break status and duration.

## UX Improvements
- Quick Actions are now at the top for immediate access.
- All break actions are visually distinct and easy to use.
- The break type selection dialog is modern, colorful, and user-friendly.
