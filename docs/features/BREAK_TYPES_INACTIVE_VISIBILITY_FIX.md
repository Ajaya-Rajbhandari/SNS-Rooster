# Break Types Inactive Visibility Fix

## Issue Description
Inactive (deactivated) break types were not visible in the Break Types Management screen, making it impossible for admins to reactivate them or manage the complete break types inventory.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **duplicate routes** in `rooster-backend/routes/adminAttendanceRoutes.js`:

### Problem Routes:
1. **Line 33:** `router.get("/break-types", auth, adminAttendanceController.getBreakTypes);`
   - This route used a controller method that filtered `{ isActive: true }` (only active break types)
   - Intended for employees to see only active break types

2. **Line 43:** `router.get("/break-types", auth, adminAuth, async (req, res) => {...});`
   - This route correctly fetched all break types with `BreakType.find({})`
   - Intended for admins to see all break types (active + inactive)

### Express Route Matching Issue:
Since Express.js uses the **first matching route**, admin requests to `/api/admin/break-types` were incorrectly handled by the first route (employee route) instead of the admin route, resulting in filtered results that excluded inactive break types.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Duplicate Route** - Deleted the first route that was filtering out inactive break types
2. **Preserved Admin Functionality** - Kept the admin route that returns all break types
3. **Maintained Employee Security** - Employee endpoint `/api/break-types` still only shows active break types

### File Modified:
- `rooster-backend/routes/adminAttendanceRoutes.js`

### Route Structure After Fix:
- **`/api/break-types`** → Employees get only **active** break types ✅
- **`/api/admin/break-types`** → Admins get **ALL** break types (active + inactive) ✅

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Admin Break Types Management Screen:
- ✅ **Active break types** display with green "Active" badges
- ✅ **Inactive break types** display with grey "Inactive" badges
- ✅ **"Activate" buttons** available for inactive break types
- ✅ **"Deactivate" buttons** available for active break types
- ✅ **Complete inventory visibility** for proper break types management

### Employee Break Selection:
- ✅ **Only active break types** visible to employees
- ✅ **Security maintained** - employees cannot see deactivated break types

## Testing Performed
1. **Database Verification** - Confirmed inactive break types exist in database
2. **Route Testing** - Verified admin endpoint returns all break types
3. **UI Testing** - Confirmed inactive break types now visible in management screen

## Impact
- **Resolves** inability to manage inactive break types
- **Enables** reactivation of previously deactivated break types
- **Improves** administrative control over break types inventory
- **Maintains** security separation between admin and employee access

## Technical Details
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js/Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Frontend**: Flutter mobile application
