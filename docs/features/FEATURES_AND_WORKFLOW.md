# SNS Rooster Payroll & Payslip Management â€“ Features & Workflow

## Major Features & Improvements

### 1. Admin Payroll Management
- Real Data Integration: Admin payroll management now uses real backend data for payslips, employees, and payroll actions.
- Payslip PDF Download: Admins can download payslips as professional, styled PDFs (with colored headers, tables, and all key details).
- Payslip Edit: Admins can edit payslips, with all fields (including pay period and issue date) required and validated.
- Payslip Status Indicator: Each payslip shows a status badge (Pending, Approved, Needs Review) with color and icon.
- Employee Comment Visibility: If an employee requests clarification, their comment is shown to the admin.
- No Delete Button: The delete button was removed for safety; payslips are now persistent records.

### 2. Employee Payroll Screen
- Status Awareness: Employees see the status of each payslip (Pending, Approved, Needs Review).
- Acknowledge & Clarification Workflow: Employees can acknowledge a payslip or request clarification (with a comment), which updates the status and notifies the admin.
- UI Robustness: All fields (pay period, issue date, gross/net pay, deductions) are null-safe and always display a fallback if missing.
- Responsive Action Buttons: Acknowledge and Request Clarification buttons are stacked vertically for mobile-friendliness.

### 3. Backend Enhancements
- Payroll Model Extended: Added `issueDate` and `payPeriod` fields (both required) to the Payroll schema.
- Status & Comment Fields: Added `status` (pending, approved, needs_review) and `employeeComment` to the Payroll schema.
- API Endpoints:
  - `PATCH /api/payroll/:payslipId/status` for employee acknowledgment/clarification.
  - PDF download endpoint returns a styled, professional payslip.
- Validation: All new and edited payslips must have `issueDate` and `payPeriod`.

### 4. Data Migration
- MongoDB Script: Provided and executed a script to backfill `issueDate` and `payPeriod` for all existing payslips, ensuring legacy data is editable and visible in the UI.

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- Professional PDF Layout: Payslip PDFs now use a table/grid layout with colored headers, clear sections, and totals.
- Status Badges: Both admin and employee screens show clear, color-coded status indicators.
- Error Handling: All null fields are handled gracefully in the UI, preventing runtime errors.
- Form Validation: Payslip creation/edit dialog enforces required fields and shows validation errors.

## 2024 Payroll Management Enhancements

### Edit Workflow for Rejected Payslips
- When an admin edits a payslip with status `needs_review` (rejected), its status is automatically set to `pending`.
- The Edit button is enabled for payslips with status `pending` or `needs_review`, and disabled for `approved` or `acknowledged`.

### Employee and Admin Comments
- Employee comments are always displayed on the payslip card if present, regardless of status.
- Admins can respond to employee comments; their response is shown in blue on the payslip card.

### Employee Name Display
- The employee's full name is displayed on each payslip card for clarity.

### Pull-to-Refresh
- Both admin and employee payroll screens support pull-to-refresh to fetch the latest data.

### Robust Edit Dialog
- The edit dialog collects data and returns it to the parent, which handles async updates and notifications, ensuring no context errors.

## Workflow Documentation

### Payslip Approval Flow
1. Admin creates a payslip (must include pay period and issue date).
2. Employee sees payslip with "Pending" status and can:
   - Acknowledge (status becomes "Approved")
   - Request Clarification (status becomes "Needs Review", with a comment)
3. Admin sees status and comment; can edit and re-issue the payslip.
4. All actions are reflected in real time for both admin and employee.

## How to Maintain and Extend
- Always require pay period and issue date for new/edited payslips.
- Use the PATCH status endpoint for employee acknowledgment/clarification.
- For new features: Consider adding notifications, audit logs, or more granular permissions.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add notifications for admin when a payslip is marked "Needs Review."
- Allow admins to "Mark as Resolved" or reset status after clarification.
- Add export to CSV/Excel for payroll data.
- Add analytics or summary reports for payroll.
