# Clock-In Reset Issue Fix

## Problem Description
The clock-in functionality in the SNS Rooster app was experiencing reset issues where users would lose their clocked-in status unexpectedly. This was causing confusion and preventing proper attendance tracking.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Mock Service Configuration Issue
- **File**: `sns_rooster/lib/services/mock_service.dart`
- **Issue**: The `useMock` flag was set to `false`, causing the app to attempt real API calls
- **Impact**: When real API calls failed (due to no backend being available), the clock-in state would reset

### 2. Field Name Inconsistency
- **File**: `sns_rooster/lib/screens/employee/employee_dashboard_screen.dart`
- **Issue**: The app was checking for `clockOutTime` field to determine clock-in status, but the mock service uses `checkOut`
- **Impact**: Incorrect state detection leading to UI showing wrong clock-in status

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enable Mock Service for Development
**File**: `sns_rooster/lib/services/mock_service.dart`
```dart
// Changed from:
const bool useMock = false; // Set to false to use real API calls

// To:
const bool useMock = true; // Set to true to use mock data for development
```

### 2. Fix Clock-In State Detection
**File**: `sns_rooster/lib/screens/employee/employee_dashboard_screen.dart`
```dart
// Updated state check to handle both field names:
_isClockedIn = attendanceProvider.currentAttendance != null && 
             (attendanceProvider.currentAttendance?['clockOutTime'] == null && 
              attendanceProvider.currentAttendance?['checkOut'] == null);
```

## Files Modified
1. `sns_rooster/lib/services/mock_service.dart` - Line 307
2. `sns_rooster/lib/screens/employee/employee_dashboard_screen.dart` - Lines 52-54, 67-69

## Testing
After implementing these fixes:
- Clock-in functionality should work consistently
- Clock-in state should persist across app navigation
- No unexpected resets should occur
- Mock data will be used for development purposes

## Future Considerations
- When switching to production, remember to set `useMock = false` and ensure real API endpoints are properly configured
- Consider standardizing field names between mock and real API responses
- Add unit tests for clock-in state management
