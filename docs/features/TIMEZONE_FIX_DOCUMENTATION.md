# Timezone Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

**Problem:** Employee dashboard was showing "Not Clocked In" status even after successful clock-in operations.

**Symptoms:**
- Users could clock in successfully (no errors)
- Backend logs showed successful attendance record creation
- Dashboard continued to show "Not Clocked In" status
- Status API returned `{"status":"not_clocked_in","attendance":null}`

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **inconsistent date handling** in the backend attendance controller:

### Before Fix:
- **`checkIn` method**: Used UTC for date storage ✅
- **`checkOut` method**: Used local server time for queries ❌
- **`endBreak` method**: Used local server time for queries ❌  
- **`getAttendanceStatus` method**: Used local server time for queries ❌

### The Problem:
1. User clocks in → Record saved with UTC date (e.g., `2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z`)
2. Dashboard checks status → Query looks for records using local time (e.g., `2024-01-14T00:00:00.000+05:00`)
3. Date mismatch → No record found → Status shows "Not Clocked In"

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Fixed `getAttendanceStatus` Method
```javascript
// Before (local time)
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

// After (UTC)
const now = new Date();
const today = new Date(Date.UTC(now.getUTCFullYear(), now.getUTCMonth(), now.getUTCDate(), 0, 0, 0, 0));
```

#### 2. Fixed `checkOut` Method
```javascript
// Before (local time)
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const tomorrow = new Date(today);
tomorrow.setDate(today.getDate() + 1);

// After (UTC)
const now = new Date();
const today = new Date(Date.UTC(now.getUTCFullYear(), now.getUTCMonth(), now.getUTCDate(), 0, 0, 0, 0));
const tomorrow = new Date(today);
tomorrow.setUTCDate(today.getUTCDate() + 1);
```

#### 3. Fixed `endBreak` Method
Applied the same UTC date handling pattern for consistency.

### Files Modified:
- `rooster-backend/controllers/attendance-controller.js`

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
DEBUG: Raw response body from getAttendanceStatusWithData: {"status":"not_clocked_in","attendance":null}
```

### After Fix:
```
DEBUG: getAttendanceStatus - Querying for userId: 685a8921be22e980a5ba2707 and date (today UTC): 2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z to 2024-01-16T00:00:00.000Z
DEBUG: getAttendanceStatus - Final status before sending: clocked_in
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Date Handling**: All attendance operations now use UTC
2. **Timezone Independence**: Works correctly regardless of server location
3. **Reliable Status Updates**: Dashboard shows correct status after clock-in/out
4. **Future-Proof**: Prevents similar timezone-related bugs

## Best Practices Established

1. **Always use UTC for date storage and queries** in attendance operations
2. **Consistent date handling** across all related methods
3. **Clear logging** with UTC timestamps for debugging
4. **Document timezone assumptions** in code comments

## Related Features

This fix ensures proper functionality for:
- Employee dashboard attendance status
- Clock-in/out operations
- Break management
- Attendance history queries
- Admin timesheet management

## Deployment Notes

- **No database migration required** - existing records remain valid
- **Backward compatible** - existing attendance records work correctly
- **Server restart required** - changes take effect after backend restart
