## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `sns_rooster/lib/screens/employee/employee_dashboard_screen.dart`: Enhanced StatusCard widget

### Key Components
1. **Break Information Processing**: 
   - Finds current active break (where endTime is null)
   - Counts total breaks for the day
   - Calculates break durations

2. **Daily Summary Calculation**:
   - Processes check-in and check-out times
   - Calculates total work time and break time
   - Computes net work time by subtracting breaks

3. **Dynamic UI Updates**:
   - Uses Consumer<AttendanceProvider> for reactive updates
   - Conditional rendering based on attendance status
   - Formatted time displays using DateFormat

### Status Cases Handled
- `not_clocked_in`: Helpful prompt to start the day
- `clocked_in`: Shows clock-in time and current work duration
- `on_break`: Detailed break information with current break details
- `clocked_out`: Comprehensive daily summary with all metrics

## User Experience Benefits
1. **Better Break Awareness**: Employees can see exactly what type of break they're on and for how long
2. **Daily Achievement Summary**: Clear overview of the day's work when clocking out
3. **Break Tracking**: Visibility into how many breaks have been taken
4. **Time Management**: Real-time work and break duration tracking
5. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded statuses and well-organized information panels
