## Overview
This document summarizes the major improvements made to the analytics features and user interface/experience in the SNS Rooster app.

---

## Features Added & Enhanced

### 1. Dynamic Analytics Range
- Users can select "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", or a custom range (1â€“90 days) for analytics.
- All analytics endpoints and charts update based on the selected range.

### 2. Custom Range Dialog
- Modern slider for selecting days.
- Bold, high-contrast number for days.
- Live preview of the date range (e.g., "From: 01 Jun 2025  To: 30 Jun 2025").
- Improved layout and accessibility.

### 3. Work Hours Trend Chart
- Chart title and X-axis labels are dynamic and reflect the selected range.
- Tooltip is fully customized:
  - Dark background
  - Bold white day label
  - Bold amber value
- Chart adapts to available data (shows as many days as there are records).

### 4. Attendance Breakdown Pie Chart
- Shows percentage inside each section (Present, Absent, Leave).
- Percentages are always black and bold for readability.
- Legend remains for clarity.

### 5. Backend Enhancements
- All analytics endpoints accept a `range` query parameter.
- Attendance analytics infer "Present" if a record has check-in and check-out but no status.
- Status mapping improved for real-world data (e.g., "COMPLETED" is treated as "Present").

### 6. General UI/UX
- All analytics and chart elements are more readable, modern, and accessible.
- Error handling and debug prints improved for easier troubleshooting.
