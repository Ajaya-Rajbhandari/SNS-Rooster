# Generate Tasks from PRD

## Overview
This document takes a Product Requirement Document (PRD) and breaks it down into detailed, actionable tasks for implementation. Each task should be specific, measurable, and achievable within a reasonable timeframe.

## Task Generation Guidelines

### Task Structure
Each task should include:
- **Task ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what needs to be done
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific criteria for completion
- **Estimated Effort**: Time estimate (hours/days)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed first
- **Files to Modify**: Specific files that will be changed
- **Testing Requirements**: What testing is needed

### Task Categories
1. **Backend Development**: API endpoints, database changes, business logic
2. **Frontend Development**: UI components, user interface, user experience
3. **Database**: Schema changes, migrations, data setup
4. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests
5. **Documentation**: API documentation, user guides, technical docs
6. **Deployment**: Configuration, environment setup, monitoring

### Task Dependencies
- Use task IDs to reference dependencies
- Ensure logical order of implementation
- Consider parallel development opportunities
- Identify critical path tasks

## Task Generation Process

### 1. Analyze PRD Sections
- Review each section of the PRD
- Identify specific implementation requirements
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Consider technical dependencies

### 2. Create Task Hierarchy
- Group related tasks together
- Use numbering system for organization
- Create main tasks and sub-tasks
- Ensure logical flow

### 3. Estimate Effort
- Consider complexity of each task
- Account for testing and documentation
- Include review and iteration time
- Be realistic about time estimates

### 4. Identify Dependencies
- Map task relationships
- Identify blocking tasks
- Consider parallel development
- Plan critical path
