# Layout Fix Documentation - Employee Dashboard Quick Actions

## Issue Description
The employee dashboard's quick actions section was experiencing layout overflow errors, specifically:
- "BOTTOM OVERLAPPED BY 31 PIXELS" error in action cards
- Text content was being cut off in "Apply Leave", "Timesheet", and "Profile" cards
- Flutter RenderFlex overflow warnings in console

## Root Cause
The `childAspectRatio` values in the `GridView.count` widget were too high, resulting in insufficient vertical space for the card content (icon + spacing + text labels).

## Solution Implemented
Adjusted the `childAspectRatio` values in `employee_dashboard_screen.dart` at line 474:

### Before:
```dart
final childAspectRatio = isTablet ? 3.0 : 2.8;
```

### After:
```dart
final childAspectRatio = isTablet ? 2.1 : 1.9;
```

## Changes Made
- **Tablet screens** (width > 600px): Reduced from `3.0` to `2.1`
- **Mobile screens**: Reduced from `2.8` to `1.9`

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/employee/employee_dashboard_screen.dart` (line 474)

## Testing Results
- ✅ Eliminated all overflow errors
- ✅ Text labels now display completely within card boundaries
- ✅ Maintained responsive design for both tablet and mobile layouts
- ✅ Preserved visual consistency and gradient card design

## Technical Details
- The lower aspect ratio values provide more vertical space for each card
- Cards maintain proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Solution is responsive and works across all screen sizes
- No impact on other dashboard components
